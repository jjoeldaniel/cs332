Welcome to the University Database Interface! This tool allows professors and students to easily access
important course and academic information.

### For Professors
Search for your class schedule by entering your social security number. You’ll see the titles,
classrooms, meeting days, and times of your courses. Count the number of students who received each distinct 
grade in any course section by entering the course and section numbers.

### For Students
Find information about specific courses by entering the course number. You’ll see all sections,
including the classroom, meeting days, times, and the number of students enrolled.
View your complete academic history by entering your campus-wide ID. You’ll get a list of all the
courses you’ve taken along with the grades received.
